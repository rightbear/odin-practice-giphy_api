Practice of "Working with APIs" in The Odin Project

Github page: https://rightbear.github.io/odin-practice-giphy-api/

I set this project as private repository to protect my API keys of Giphy website. I will change the project back to public repository in the future.

(2025/06/26) I complete this practice with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I use Javascript concepts such as eventListener, callbacks and Promise to request GIF files on Giphy website. I add functions like validating keywords in searchbar and checking the status code when fetching GIFs. I mainly use concepts of Promise to ensure the result of response message can be asynchronously handled in JSON format. Finally, with methods in the Promise, I can successfully display GIFs when user search with keywords and click the buttons. This activity strengthens my skills in HTML and JavaScript.
